<div class="advice">
<h3>Before you download and use assets</h3>
<p>Online stores and crowdsourced libraries are great. But be careful with any online resource like 3D models, audio, or animation. Anything created by a human being is intellectual property and is protected by a legal framework. Copyright laws provide clear directions about use cases for intellectual property.</p>
<p>Read the license of the assets you download. You should be fine using any resource to practice, but do not publish a project that includes assets you did not create, unless the permission to do so is explicit in the license.</p>
<p>Do not let this warning discourage you. There are free-to-use, Creative Commons, CC0, and public domain assets online. If you want to use anything, confirm your permissions and keep a folder with all the licenses you need for any project.</p>
